# selenium-webdriver-demo-javascript

This is a sample test script that creates a Selenium session and then navigates to google.com for 10 seconds. This can be used for different kinds of triaging of docker-selenium and docker-seleniarm issues.


## Run the test

```
$ node remote-demo.js
```

Default port is 4444. Optionally, pass in a different port with the `-p` flag:

```
$ node remote-demo.js -p 4445
```
