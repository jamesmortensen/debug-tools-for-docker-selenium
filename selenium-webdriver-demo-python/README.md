# selenium-webdriver-demo-python

This is a sample test script that creates a Selenium session and then navigates to google.com for 10 seconds. This can be used for different kinds of triaging of docker-selenium and docker-seleniarm issues.


## Run the test

```
$ sh run.sh -p ${port}  # replace ${port} with the port number, usually 4444
```
